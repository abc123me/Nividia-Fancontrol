# Nividia-Fancontrol
It's a script that controls the fan on a nvidia graphics card

## Progress
Currently it is in its very early stages but still usable
(I'm working on making it better)

## Usage
- `python3 main.py` No special privledges required!
- `python3 main.py -v` Same as before but launches it in verbose mode
### Modifications
You can modify main.py to make a custom fan curve, or use a different GPU/Fan.

## Tested configurations
- Ubuntu with GTX760 and GTX1060 6GB (No problems)
- LXDE with GTX1060 6GB (No problems)
- Everything else is untested (however it will probably work)
